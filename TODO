- [x] complete generator and iterator types in the parser
- [ ] add support for missing types (slices, anything else?)
- [x] update the class type handler to do better class name normalization and import generation
- [ ] use gentests.py to generate more test cases, including of the above
- [x] expand the logic in is_trivial to cover more cases
- [x] incorporate this into stubber
- [x] generate stubs and see how well they work
- [ ] try to fix the issue with 'a's being stripped off
- [ ] output relative imports
- [ ] output attributes
- [ ] make sure we also parse formal types
- [ ] remove private methods
- [ ] support 'common' map files
- [ ] print context in log 

Note: in some cases we may need to suppress QUALNAME matching in favor of other things (like basic_type).
In that case use qualname instead (this requires changing handling from token type to tree type).
