- [x] complete generator and iterator types in the parser
- [ ] add support for missing types (slices, anything else?)
- [x] update the class type handler to do better class name normalization and import generation
- [ ] use gentests.py to generate more test cases, including of the above
- [x] expand the logic in is_trivial to cover more cases
- [ ] incorporate this into stubber
- [ ] generate stubs and see how well they work

Note: in some cases we may need to suppress QUALNAME matching in favor of other things (like basic_type).
In that case use qualname instead (this requires changing handling from token type to tree type).
